# RandomJapaneseLetters
A Japanese letter randomizer is a tool or program that can generate random Japanese characters or letters. These characters may be from the Japanese syllabary (hiragana and katakana) or from the Japanese writing system (kanji). The purpose of a Japanese letter randomizer is to provide a way for people to practice their knowledge of Japanese characters and improve their ability to recognize and write them. Some Japanese letter randomizers may also include options to customize the types of characters that are generated, such as only generating hiragana or only generating kanji. Overall, a Japanese letter randomizer can be a useful tool for anyone learning Japanese or looking to improve their knowledge of the language.
